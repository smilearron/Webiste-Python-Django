            <p></p>
            <span class="font18">One-third to one-half of the population over age 65 reports some difficulties with balance or ambulation, which occur more likely on patients with neurological or musculoskeletal disorders. Thus clinicians implement lab-based balance tests to evaluate the function of the vestibular system in the inner ear and identify balance problem sources for the patients. However, classic balance tests use qualitative, semi-subjective standards based on clinicians’ personal judgment, and these tests confined in traditional gait lab environment may lead to environmental bias concerns and cannot reflect patients’ natural behaviors in their used environment. The developed system is evaluated with standard balance tests (Limits of Stability, Sit-To-Stand, and Rhythmic Weight Shift), whereas the data collected are analyzed with data mining techniques to verify the reliability of the designated process. Certain parameters are computed such as Center of Gravity (COG), weight transfer time, and sway velocities. This system provides adequate data for balance ability analysis and simplifies the scoring processes in balance tests. The results show that the system is informational and reliable in the process of determining balance status during tests with additional advantages in high portability and efficient review communications.

            <p></p>
            <span class="font18">Frozen shoulder, or adhesive capsulitis, is a condition caused by impaired soft tissues and the articular capsule of the shoulder. It commonly occurs in people aged 40 to 65 years, and it’s more likely to appear in females than in males.1 Frozen shoulder is characterized by painful and limited active and passive range of motion. The main treatment involves proper shoulder exercises and joint mobilization to break up adhesions at the joint capsules and improve joint mobility and functions. However, due to a lack of persistence, not all patients complete rehabilitation. To address this, we created a virtual reality game-based treatment system that encourages patients to participate in regular rehabilitation. Using our system, patients can inquire freely about their rehabilitation progress through real-time sensing and game-based feedback. Six progressive and hierarchical training tasks make each training step adjustable based on the patient’s physical condition.

            </span>
          <p></p>
          <span class="font18">Dizziness is a major consequence of imbalance and vestibular dysfunction. Compared to surgery and drug treatments, balance training is non-invasive and more desired. However, training exercises are usually tedious and the assessment tool is insufficient to diagnose patient’s severity rapidly.</span>

          <span class="font18">• Methods:
          </span>
          <p></p>
          <span class="font18">An interactive virtual reality (VR) game-based rehabilitation program that adopted Cawthorne–Cooksey exercises, and a sensor-based measuring system were introduced. To verify the therapeutic effect, a clinical experiment with 48 patients and 36 normal subjects was conducted. Quantified balance indices were measured and analyzed by statistical tools and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Results: In terms of balance indices, patients who completed the training process are progressed and the difference between normal subjects and patients is obvious.
