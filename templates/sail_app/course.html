          <p></p>
            <span class="font18">The emergence of multi-thread GPUs and the combination of them with multi-core CPUs have made huge computing possible by laptops and facilitated peta-scale computing in clusters with great accuracy, controllability and observability. Algorithms can be implemented 100x faster by GPUs in comparison to CPUs. The motivation of tapping the highest potential of using GPUs has led the generation and development of special C based language programming for GPUs. This course aims to cover the fundamentals of principal components of graphics processing units (GPU) architecture. Then, the course focuses on commodity language (CUDA) programming. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model produced by NVIDIA that provides required libraries for GPU computations while the programming on that can be implemented in popular languages such as C, C++, Fortran etc. and be extended to the suitable format. In addition to that, the course introduces and discusses high performance computing on GPUs, parallel nature and programming, performance optimization, graphics pipeline, microarchitectures and network topologies. Finally, the special usages of GPU in machine learning will be analysed.</span></span>

          <p></p>
            <span class="font18">We open a graduate-level mHealth class for medical and health problem research every Fall semester. In this lab-based class, we will use Android smartphones as vehicles to explore human-centric sensing, wireless communication with microprocessor, and learning-based data analytics. We will have 6 team-based labs (tutorial-guided projects), one presentation and final report, and one final exam. You will be requested to practice Latex style writing to create a qualified research report in the end of class.</span>

            <span class="font18bold">Course Learning Objectives:</span>
          <p></p>
            <span class="font18">Advances in communications, computer, and medical technology have facilitated the practice of personalized health, which utilizes sensory computational communication systems to support improved and more personalized healthcare and healthy lifestyle choices. The current proliferation of broadband wireless services, along with more powerful and convenient handheld devices, is helping to introduce real-time monitoring and guidance for a wide array of patients. Indeed, a large research community and a nascent industry is beginning to connect medical care with technology developers, vendors of wireless and sensing hardware systems, network service providers, and data management communities. Students in the course and labs will explore cutting-edge technologies in 1) mobile computing technologies and 2) healthcare/medical applications, through lectures, lab assignments, exams, presentations, and final projects. The overall course objectives are to introduce electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science students the fundamentals of wearable sensors, mobile health informatics, big data analysis, Internet of Things (IoT), and human computer interaction considerations.

            <span class="font18">Today processors are used in all forms of electronic equipment and hence the course is relevant for computer engineers as well as software developer designing cross-platform embedded systems and IoT services where they are often important to make efficient use of the resources of the processor in order to optimize performance, cost, and energy consumption. This course provides students the opportunity to study and evaluate a modern computer architecture design. The course covers topics in fundamentals of computer design, performance, cost, instruction set design, processor implementation, control unit, pipelining, memory hierarchy, and computer arithmetic.</span>

          <p></p>
            <span class="font18">During weekly lectures, students are expected to learn the organizational structure that determines the capabilities and performance of computer systems, to understand the interactions between the computer’s architecture and its software, and to understand cost performance trade-offs. A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to describe the internal structure of a processor, including pipeline, cache memory, memory hierarchy, virtual memory and explain how hardware (technology and architecture) and software (instruction set, compiler and operating system) forms a whole, and that the interface between the two is a key element in all systems.</span>
